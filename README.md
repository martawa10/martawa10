<h1 align="center">Hello, I am Marta 👋</h1>  

My name is Marta Wardzińska. Welcome to my Project Portfolio! 

In 2018 I decided to change my career from environmental engineering to
data science. The same year I started my studies and also change a job for
IT-related field. Now I am highly motivated to pursue a career that will give me an opportunity to develop my analytical, data science, and data visualization skills. After almost 2 years of studies, I am more than sure it is a path I want to follow.

I am aware that I still have a lot to learn. Currently, I focus on enhancing my knowledge in Machine Learning, Python programming 🐍 , and data visualization in Tableau and PowerBI.
